    "text": "Part 1: Healthcare Access for Vulnerable Populations\n\nResearch Question\nWhich Pennsylvania counties have the highest proportion of vulnerable populations (elderly + low-income) living far from hospitals?\nMy analysis should identify counties that should be priorities for healthcare investment and policy intervention.\n#Analysis Steps\nI have Completed the following analysis, tried to give the brief explanations about each step (Although if you want codes you may check technical details through my source code on GitHub:\n#Step 1: Data Detail\nI have used the following data :\n- Pennsylvania county boundaries\n- Pennsylvania hospitals\n- Pennsylvania census tracts\nI will answer the following questions in my analysis :\n- How many hospitals are in your dataset?\n- How many census tracts?\n- What coordinate reference system is each dataset in?\n\n#I am obtaining tract-level demographic data for Pennsylvania from American Census Survey data portal.\nFollowing are the variables I am taking into consideration\n- Total population\n- Median household income\n- Population 65 years and over (you may need to sum multiple age categories)\nQuestions to answer:\n\nWhat year of ACS data are you using?\nI am using 2022 ACS data.\nHow many tracts have missing income data?\nThere is 0 tract with missing income data.\nWhat is the median income across all PA census tracts?\nMedian income across all PA census tracts = 70188\n\nVulnerable Populations:\nI have classified those people as vulnerable whose income is less than 50000 and whom age is above 65 years of age in all tracts of Pensylvania.\nThese two are my criteria:\n1. Low median household income (median_incomeE &lt; 50000)\n2. Significant elderly population (Population_65_over &gt; 200)\n\nMy replies to some important questions related to my analysis:\n\nWhat income threshold did you choose and why?\nI have chosen an income threshold of $50,000 because it is a common benchmark for low-income status in many policy analyses. It also allows us to capture a significant portion of the population that may be struggling financially, while still including enough tracts for meaningful analysis.\nWhat elderly population threshold did you choose and why?\nI have chosen an elderly population threshold of 200 because it represents a significant number of elderly residents in a tract, which may indicate a higher need for healthcare services. This threshold allows us to focus on tracts that have a substantial elderly population, which is often more vulnerable to health issues and may require more frequent access to hospitals.\nHow many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\nThere are total 555 tracts that meet the vulnerability criteria of having a median household income below $50,000 and an elderly population of over 200.\nWhat percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?\nTotal 16.1103 percent of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by the defined criteria. That are basically 555 tracts out of total 3447 tracts in Pennsylvania. Simply 555/3447*100 = 16.1103 percent.\n\n\n\n\nDistance calculation to Hospitals\nI calculated the distance to the nearest hospital from each vulnerable tract.\nYour Task:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy replies to some important points:\n\nUse an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania\nI have used the PROJCRS[“NAD83 / UTM zone 17N”] (EPSG:26917) which is a common projected coordinate system for the eastern United States, including Pennsylvania. It uses meters as units, which allows for accurate distance calculations.\nCalculate distances in miles\nDistance has been calculated in mile (1 Mile = 1609.34 Meters)\nExplain why you chose your projection\nI have chosen this projection because it is a common projected coordinate system for the eastern United States, including Pennsylvania. It uses meters as units, which allows for accurate distance calculations.\n\nQuestions to answer:\n\nWhat is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts?\nThe average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts is approximately 2.619415 miles.\n\n\nWhat is the maximum distance?\nThe maximum distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts is approximately 18.96458 miles.\nHow many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital?\nThere are total 128 vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.\n\n\n\nIdentification of Underserved Areas\nI Defined “underserved” as :\nvulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital are considered underserved because they likely face significant barriers to accessing healthcare services, which can lead to worse health outcomes. This distance can be a major obstacle for individuals who may not have reliable transportation or who have mobility issues, particularly among the elderly population. Identifying these underserved areas is crucial for targeting healthcare investments and policy interventions to improve access and equity in healthcare services."

    "text": "Primary results:\n\nHow many tracts are underserved?\nThere are total 9 tracts that are underserved, meaning they are vulnerable and located more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.\nWhat percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved?\nApproximately 1.62% of vulnerable tracts are underserved, meaning they are located more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital. This is calculated by dividing the number of underserved tracts (9) by the total number of vulnerable tracts (555) and multiplying by 100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes this surprise you? Why or why not?\nIt is somewhat surprising that only a small percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved, given the significant barriers to healthcare access that can exist in rural and low-income areas. However, it may also reflect the fact that many vulnerable populations are located in more urban or suburban areas where hospitals are more accessible. It highlights the importance of looking beyond just the number of vulnerable tracts and considering the geographic distribution and specific needs of these populations when planning healthcare investments and interventions."

    "text": "Aggregate to County Level:\nI used spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\ncounty-level statistics:\nThe number of vulnerable tracts in each county is calculated by performing a spatial join between the vulnerable tracts and the county boundaries, and then counting the number of vulnerable tracts that fall within each county. This will gave us a count of how many vulnerable tracts are located in each county, which can help identify which counties have the highest concentration of vulnerable populations that may be underserved in terms of healthcare access. Philadelphia County has the highest number of vulnerable tracts, with a total of 138 vulnerable tracts. This indicates that Philadelphia County has a significant concentration of vulnerable populations that may be at risk of being underserved in terms of healthcare access, particularly if many of these tracts are located far from hospitals. Allegheny County has the second highest number of vulnerable tracts, with a total of 80 vulnerable tracts. This suggests that Allegheny County also has a significant concentration of vulnerable populations that may require targeted healthcare investments and policy interventions to improve access to healthcare services. Luzerne County has the third highest number of vulnerable tracts, with a total of 29 vulnerable tracts. This indicates that Luzerne County also has a notable concentration of vulnerable populations that may be at risk of being underserved in terms of healthcare access. These findings highlight the importance of focusing healthcare investments and policy interventions in these counties to address the needs of vulnerable populations and improve healthcare access and equity.\n\n\n\nThe number of vulnerable tracts in each county\n\n\nName of Counties\nnumber of vulnerable tracts\n\n\n\n\nAdams County\n1\n\n\nAllegheny County\n80\n\n\nArmstrong County\n2\n\n\nBeaver County\n12\n\n\nBedford County\n2\n\n\nBerks County\n11\n\n\nBlair County\n8\n\n\nBradford County\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of underserved tracts:\nThe number of underserved tracts in each county is calculated by performing a spatial join between the underserved tracts (vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital) and the county boundaries, and then counting the number of underserved tracts that fall within each county. This will give us a count of how many underserved tracts are located in each county, which can help identify which counties have the highest concentration of vulnerable populations that may be at risk of being underserved in terms of healthcare access. Clearfield County has the highest number of underserved tracts, with a total of 3 underserved tracts. This indicates that Pike County has a significant concentration of vulnerable populations that are located far from hospitals and may be at risk of being underserved in terms of healthcare access. Forest County has the second highest number of underserved tracts, with a total of 2 underserved tracts. This suggests that Chester County also has a notable concentration of vulnerable populations that are located far from hospitals and may require targeted healthcare investments and policy interventions to improve access to healthcare services.\n\n\n\nThe number of vulnerable tracts in each county that are more than 15 Miles away from county\n\n\nName of Counties\nnumber of vulnerable tracts\n\n\n\n\nCameron County\n1\n\n\nCentre County\n1\n\n\nClearfield County\n3\n\n\nForest County\n2\n\n\nJuniata County\n1\n\n\nMonroe County\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved # Calculate percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\n\nApproximately 0.02% of vulnerable tracts are underserved, meaning they are located more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital. This is calculated by dividing the number of underserved tracts (9) by the total number of vulnerable tracts (555) and multiplying by 100.\n\nAverage distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts The average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts is approximately 2.619415 miles. This is calculated by taking the mean of the dist_to_nearest variable for all vulnerable tracts, which represents the distance from each tract centroid to the nearest hospital.\n\n\nTotal vulnerable population\nThe total vulnerable population is calculated by summing the total_popE variable for all vulnerable tracts. This gives us an estimate of the total number of 1861909 people living in vulnerable tracts, which can help us understand the scale of the population that is at risk of being vulnerable in terms of healthcare access.\n\n\n\n\nThe total vulnerable population\n\n\nTotal vulnerable population\n\n\n\n\n1,861,909\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers to some important questions\n\nWhich 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts? The 5 counties with the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts are Clearfield County, Forest County, Cameron County,\nCentre County and Juniata County(Although these counties have same percentage i-e Cameron County, Centre County and Juniata County). These counties have the highest proportion of vulnerable tracts that are located more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital, indicating that they may be at greater risk of being underserved in terms of healthcare access. Targeting healthcare investments and policy interventions in these counties could help improve access to healthcare services for vulnerable populations and address disparities in healthcare access and outcomes.\nWhich counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals? the counties with the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals are Clearfield County, Forest County, Cameron County, Monroe County. These counties have the highest number of vulnerable tracts that are located more than 15 miles (i-e 18+) from the nearest hospital, indicating that they may have a significant population of vulnerable individuals who are at risk of being underserved in terms of healthcare access.

I will be using the data of Philadelphia city. I will be using the data of 2022 ACS for census tracts. I will be using the data of parks and street trees from OpenDataPhilly. I have gotten data from get_acs function for census tracts. I have also read the data of parks and street trees using st_read function. I have transformed the data of parks and street trees to the same projection as census tracts. I have also calculated the coordinates of parks and street trees using st_coordinates function. I have also calculated the median income and median population.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n|\n| | 0% |\n|= | 1% |\n|= | 2% |\n|== | 3% |\n|=== | 4% |\n|=== | 5% |\n|==== | 6% |\n|===== | 7% |\n|===== | 8% |\n|====== | 9% |\n|======= | 10% |\n|======== | 11% |\n|======== | 12% |\n|========= | 13% |\n|========== | 14% |\n|========== | 15% |\n|=========== | 16% |\n|============ | 17% |\n|============ | 18% |\n|============= | 19% |\n|============== | 20% |\n|============== | 21% |\n|=============== | 22% |\n|================ | 23% |\n|================ | 24% |\n|================= | 25% |\n|================== | 26% |\n|=================== | 26% |\n|=================== | 27% |\n|==================== | 28% |\n|===================== | 29% |\n|===================== | 30% |\n|====================== | 31% |\n|======================= | 32% |\n|======================= | 33% |\n|======================== | 34% |\n|========================= | 35% |\n|========================= | 36% |\n|========================== | 37% |\n|=========================== | 38% |\n|=========================== | 39% |\n|============================ | 40% |\n|============================= | 41% |\n|============================== | 42% |\n|============================== | 43% |\n|=============================== | 44% |\n|================================ | 45% |\n|================================ | 46% |\n|================================= | 47% |\n|================================== | 48% |\n|================================== | 49% |\n|=================================== | 50% |\n|==================================== | 51% |\n|==================================== | 52% |\n|===================================== | 53% |\n|====================================== | 54% |\n|====================================== | 55% |\n|======================================= | 56% |\n|======================================== | 57% |\n|========================================= | 58% |\n|========================================= | 59% |\n|========================================== | 60% |\n|=========================================== | 61% |\n|=========================================== | 62% |\n|============================================ | 63% |\n|============================================= | 64% |\n|============================================= | 65% |\n|============================================== | 66% |\n|=============================================== | 67% |\n|=============================================== | 68% |\n|================================================ | 69% |\n|================================================= | 70% |\n|================================================= | 71% |\n|================================================== | 72% |\n|=================================================== | 73% |\n|=================================================== | 74% |\n|==================================================== | 75% |\n|===================================================== | 76% |\n|====================================================== | 77% |\n|======================================================= | 78% |\n|======================================================== | 79% |\n|======================================================== | 80% |\n|========================================================= | 81% |\n|========================================================== | 82% |\n|========================================================== | 83% |\n|=========================================================== | 84% |\n|============================================================ | 85% |\n|============================================================ | 86% |\n|============================================================= | 87% |\n|============================================================== | 88% |\n|============================================================== | 89% |\n|=============================================================== | 90% |\n|================================================================ | 91% |\n|================================================================= | 92% |\n|================================================================= | 93% |\n|================================================================== | 94% |\n|=================================================================== | 95% |\n|=================================================================== | 96% |\n|==================================================================== | 97% |\n|===================================================================== | 98% |\n|===================================================================== | 99% |\n|======================================================================| 100%\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI transformed the data of Philadelphia census tracts to the same projection as parks and street trees, which is NAD83 / UTM zone 17N (EPSG:26917).

First, a spatial join (st_join) is conducted between the street tree point dataset and the Philadelphia census tract polygon dataset, ensuring that only trees located within tract boundaries are retained . This operation assigns each individual tree to the census tract in which it geographically falls. Next, the joined dataset is grouped by tract name and the number of trees in each tract is counted using the count() function, producing a summary table of total trees per census tract. The geometry column is then removed using st_drop_geometry() so that the data can be handled as a standard tabular dataframe for non-spatial processing. After this, the tree count data are merged back into the original census tract dataset using a left_join based on the tract name, ensuring that each tract polygon now contains both its demographic attributes (including total population) and the corresponding number of trees. Finally, a new variable, tree_canopy_per_capita, is calculated by dividing the number of trees in each tract by the total population estimate (total_popE). This produces a standardized per capita measure of tree availability, allowing for meaningful comparison of urban greenery distribution across census tracts regardless of population size. And then we used Kable function to show the first 10 rows of the data. Results shows that Census Tract 369.01; Philadelphia County; Pennsylvania has the highest number of per capita trees and that are 8.48 in number. while Census Tract 9809.05; Philadelphia County; Pennsylvania has the least number of per capita trees. ”\nData Sources used in above analysis are:\nOpenDataPhilly: https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/ - Most datasets available as GeoJSON, Shapefile, or CSV with coordinates - Always check the Metadata for a data dictionary of the fields. - Pennsylvania Open Data: https://data.pa.gov/ - Census Bureau (via tidycensus): Demographics, economic indicators, commute patterns - TIGER/Line (via tigris): Geographic boundaries ”\nAnswers to some important Questions : - What dataset did you choose and why? We used Green Space Equity related data sets which include Street Trees, parks & Census tracts (race/income demographics) - What is the data source and date? OpenDataPhilly:** https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/ Street Trees, parks = 2025 while Census tracts (race/income demographics) =2022 - What CRS is it in? Did you need to transform it? Yes transformed it to NAD83 / UTM zone 17N” EPSG:26917.\nresearch statement:\nMy research analysis answers the low income and vulnerable minorities access to parks in each tract of the Philadelphia.\nI used all these spatial analysis along with other spatial analysis too. - Buffers - Spatial joins - Spatial filtering with predicates - Distance calculations - Intersections or unions - Point-in-polygon aggregation"
