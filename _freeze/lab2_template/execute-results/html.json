Low median household income (median_incomeE < 50000)    \n2. Significant elderly population (Population_65_over > 200)  \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n##  My replies to some important questions:\n\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">- What income threshold did you choose and why?   \nI have chosen an income threshold of $50,000 because it is a common benchmark for low-income status in many policy analyses. It also allows us to capture a significant portion of the population that may be struggling financially, while still including enough tracts for meaningful analysis.\n- What elderly population threshold did you choose and why?   \nI have chosen an elderly population threshold of 200 because it represents a significant number of elderly residents in a tract, which may indicate a higher need for healthcare services. This threshold allows us to focus on tracts that have a substantial elderly population, which is often more vulnerable to health issues and may require more frequent access to hospitals.\n- How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?    \nThere are total 555 tracts that meet the vulnerability criteria of having a median household income below $50,000 and an elderly population of over 200.\n- What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?     \nTotal 16.1103 percent of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by the defined criteria. That are basically 555 tracts out of total 3447 tracts in Pennsylvania. Simply 555/3447*100 = 16.1103 percent.</div>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Distance calculation to Hospitals \n\nThe points picture below shows the centers of vulnerable tracts. Starting from here, I calculated the distance to the nearest hospital from each vulnerable tract. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab2_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## My replies to some important points:\n\n- Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania    \n  I have used the PROJCRS[\"NAD83 / UTM zone 17N\"] (EPSG:26917) which is a common projected coordinate system for the eastern United States, including Pennsylvania. It uses meters as units, which allows for accurate distance calculations.\n  \n- Calculate distances in miles    \n  Distance has been calculated in mile (1 Mile = 1609.34 Meters)  \n  \n- Explain why you chose your projection    \n  I have chosen this projection because it is a common projected coordinate system for the eastern United States, including Pennsylvania. It uses meters as units, which allows for accurate distance calculations.\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n- What is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts?     \n  The average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts is approximately 2.619415 miles.   \n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n- What is the maximum distance?     \n  The maximum distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts is approximately 18.96458 miles.    \n  \n- How many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital?    \nThere are total 128 vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.    \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n  \n\n## Identification of Underserved Areas    \n\nI Defined \"underserved\" as :    \n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"> Vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital are considered underserved because they likely face significant barriers to accessing healthcare services, which can lead to worse health outcomes. This distance can be a major obstacle for individuals who may not have reliable transportation or who have mobility issues, particularly among the elderly population. Identifying these underserved areas is crucial for targeting healthcare investments and policy interventions to improve access and equity in healthcare services. </div>\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Primary results:  \n- How many tracts are underserved?    \n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are total 9 tracts that are underserved, meaning they are vulnerable and located more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.</div>\n- What percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved?    \n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Approximately 1.62% of vulnerable tracts are underserved, meaning they are located more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital. This is calculated by dividing the number of underserved tracts (9) by the total number of vulnerable tracts (555) and multiplying by 100.</div>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab2_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n- Does this surprise you? Why or why not?    \n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is somewhat surprising that only a small percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved, given the significant barriers to healthcare access that can exist in rural and low-income areas. However, it may also reflect the fact that many vulnerable populations are located in more urban or suburban areas where hospitals are more accessible. It highlights the importance of looking beyond just the number of vulnerable tracts and considering the geographic distribution and specific needs of these populations when planning healthcare investments and interventions.</div>\n\n---\n\n## Aggregate to County Level:   \nI used spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n\n# county-level statistics:   \n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThe number of vulnerable tracts in each county is calculated by performing a spatial join between the vulnerable tracts and the county boundaries, and then counting the number of vulnerable tracts that fall within each county. This will gave us a count of how many vulnerable tracts are located in each county, which can help identify which counties have the highest concentration of vulnerable populations that may be underserved in terms of healthcare access. Philadelphia County has the highest number of vulnerable tracts, with a total of 138 vulnerable tracts. This indicates that Philadelphia County has a significant concentration of vulnerable populations that may be at risk of being underserved in terms of healthcare access, particularly if many of these tracts are located far from hospitals. Allegheny County has the second highest number of vulnerable tracts, with a total of 80 vulnerable tracts. This suggests that Allegheny County also has a significant concentration of vulnerable populations that may require targeted healthcare investments and policy interventions to improve access to healthcare services. Luzerne County has the third highest number of vulnerable tracts, with a total of 29 vulnerable tracts. This indicates that Luzerne County also has a notable concentration of vulnerable populations that may be at risk of being underserved in terms of healthcare access. These findings highlight the importance of focusing healthcare investments and policy interventions in these counties to address the needs of vulnerable populations and improve healthcare access and equity. \n</div>  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: The number of vulnerable tracts in each county\n\n|Name of Counties | number of vulnerable tracts|\n|:----------------|---------------------------:|\n|Adams County     |                           1|\n|Allegheny County |                          80|\n|Armstrong County |                           2|\n|Beaver County    |                          12|\n|Bedford County   |                           2|\n|Berks County     |                          11|\n|Blair County     |                           8|\n|Bradford County  |                           1|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Number of underserved tracts:  \n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The number of underserved tracts in each county is calculated by performing a spatial join between the underserved tracts (vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital) and the county boundaries, and then counting the number of underserved tracts that fall within each county.

First, a spatial join (st_join) is conducted between the street tree point dataset and the Philadelphia census tract polygon dataset, ensuring that only trees located within tract boundaries are retained . This operation assigns each individual tree to the census tract in which it geographically falls. Next, the joined dataset is grouped by tract name and the number of trees in each tract is counted using the count() function, producing a summary table of total trees per census tract. The geometry column is then removed using st_drop_geometry() so that the data can be handled as a standard tabular dataframe for non-spatial processing. After this, the tree count data are merged back into the original census tract dataset using a left_join based on the tract name, ensuring that each tract polygon now contains both its demographic attributes (including total population) and the corresponding number of trees. Finally, a new variable, tree_canopy_per_capita, is calculated by dividing the number of trees in each tract by the total population estimate (total_popE). This produces a standardized per capita measure of tree availability, allowing for meaningful comparison of urban greenery distribution across census tracts regardless of population size. And then we used Kable function to show the first 10 rows of the data.\nResults shows that Census Tract 369.01; Philadelphia County; Pennsylvania has the highest number of per capita trees and that are 8.48 in number. while Census Tract 9809.05; Philadelphia County; Pennsylvania has the least number of per capita trees. \"\n\nI believe that investment in urban forestry is a critical, multi-functional strategy that merges environmental justice with climate resilience, directly addressing the disproportionate impacts of climate change on underserved communities. By strategically expanding tree canopy in low-income neighborhoods and areas with higher populations of color, which often suffer from extreme \"heat island\" effects and poorer air quality, cities can proactively reduce heat-related health hazards, lower energy burdens, and manage stormwater runoff. Unlike conventional infrastructure, urban trees provide compounded returns on investment over time, offering natural, cost-effective, and long-term solutions that enhance urban livability. Therefore, prioritizing urban forestry—supported by federal funding and local stewardship—is essential for creating sustainable, equitable cities that are better equipped to handle the escalating pressures of climate-related disasters.</div>\n\n\nData Sources used in above analysis are:   \n\n**OpenDataPhilly:** https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/    \n- Most datasets available as GeoJSON, Shapefile, or CSV with coordinates    \n- Always check the Metadata for a data dictionary of the fields.    \n- **Pennsylvania Open Data:** https://data.pa.gov/    \n- **Census Bureau (via tidycensus):** Demographics, economic indicators, commute patterns    \n- **TIGER/Line (via tigris):** Geographic boundaries    \n\"\n\n\nAnswers to some important Questions :     \n- What dataset did you choose and why?    \nWe used Green Space Equity related data sets which include Street Trees, parks & Census tracts (race/income demographics)    \n- What is the data source and date?    \nOpenDataPhilly:** https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/        \nStreet Trees, parks = 2025 while Census tracts (race/income demographics) =2022     \n- What CRS is it in?
